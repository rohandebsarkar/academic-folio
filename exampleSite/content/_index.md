Hi I am **Sanjeet** was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. He is best known for developing the **_theory of relativity_**, but he also made important contributions to the development of **_quantum mechanics_**. Together **_relativity_** and **_quantum mechanics_** formed the two pillars of modern physics.

His **_mass–energy_** equivalence formula `E = mc²`, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed _"the world's most famous equation"_. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics _"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"_, a pivotal step in the development of **_quantum theory_**. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in _"Einstein"_ becoming synonymous with _"genius"_. **_Einsteinium_**, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.
