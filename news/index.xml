It reconciled Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing changes to mechanics, resulting from analysis based on empirical evidence that the speed of light is independent of the motion of the observer. Discredited the concept of a &amp;ldquo;luminiferous ether&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
