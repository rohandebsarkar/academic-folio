&lt;p>I also understand that comprehending this stuff is slightly challenging if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a strong mathematics background.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main difference between Bayesian and Non-Bayesian regression is that Bayesian regression assumes that weights are Random variables.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>biography</title><link>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/bio/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/bio/</guid><description>&lt;p>Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Attention and Augmented Recurrent Neural Networks</title><link>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/distill/example/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/distill/example/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

&lt;p>Is it advisable for one who is not an expert on economic and social issues to express views on the
subject of socialism? I believe for a number of reasons that it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let us first consider the question from the point of view of scientific knowledge. It might appear
that there are no essential methodological differences between astronomy and economics: scientists
in both fields attempt to discover laws of general acceptability for a circumscribed group of
phenomena in order to make the interconnection of these phenomena as clearly understandable as
possible. But in reality such methodological differences do exist. The discovery of general laws in
the field of economics is made difficult by the circumstance that observed economic phenomena are
often affected by many factors which are very hard to evaluate separately. In addition, the
experience which has accumulated since the beginning of the so-called civilized period of human
history has — as is well known — been largely influenced and limited by causes which are by no
means exclusively economic in nature. For example, most of the major states of history owed their
existence to conquest. The conquering peoples established themselves, legally and economically, as
the privileged class of the conquered country. They seized for themselves a monopoly of the land
ownership and appointed a priesthood from among their own ranks. The priests, in control of
education, made the class division of society into a permanent institution and created a system of
values by which the people were thenceforth, to a large extent unconsciously, guided in their social
behavior.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Albert Einstein's paper on the mass energy equivalence (E = mc²) was published</title><link>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/news/mass-energy-equivalence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 1905 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/news/mass-energy-equivalence/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Albert Einstein's paper on special theory of relativity was published</title><link>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/news/special-relativity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 1905 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rohandebsarkar.github.io/academic-folio/news/special-relativity/</guid><description>&lt;p>The paper was titled the &lt;code>On the electrodynamics of moving bodies&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
